## Rules for the 100%

As stated in [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/syphon_filter_2?h=100&rules=game&x=zd3le0vd), here are the rules for the 100% :

- unlock every multiplayer stages
- unlock every multiplayer characters
- unlock every bonus sequences
- open every weapon boxes in the game (not the ones containing flak jackets)

Valkyrie_ZB has provided a [document](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/syphon_filter_2/resources/jixcf) for the 100%.

To unlock bonus sequences, the game has to be played in hard difficulty.

When Gabe / Lian says "Got it" during the game then a secret is unlocked.

To see the currently unlocked secrets, pause the game and go to `Options` then `Cheats`.

### Hard difficulty

#### Unlock hard difficulty

The hard difficulty is unlocked by holding Up + L1 + Select + Square + Circle + X + R2 at the title screen (a "ding" sound is played).

#### Differences between hard and normal difficulty

In a dedicated [gamefaqs' french page](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/198877-syphon-filter-2/faqs/49529), differences are listed for the hard difficulty :

- More enemies
- Enemies hide more and target better
- More enemies will target your head
- During manual aim (L1), head shots are no more indicated
- Enemies take sometimes other routes when they patrol (on stealthy missions)

Differences by level are listed too but I just want to highlight that yes some enemies are better shooters and so, some strats are possible in normal difficulty but may not be possible in hard difficulty.

## Notes

This is the summary of all the tricks / glitches that are done during the run.

My inspirations for this 100% TAS came from :

- [Any% runs](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/syphon_filter_2)
- [Any% segmented run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EDYUJKtz8) of L&K (Loopaddict & Kopeekka)
- [100% run](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/166393089) of Valkyrie_ZB
- [IL, level 4](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/syphon_filter_2/runs/zgkd96ey) of Tromboncino
- @ГеймерСони-м7у in the comments of my first published draft
- Personal findings

### Level 1

#### No stun after parachute

At 1:09, you can avoid being stunned when landing and releasing the parachute by ascending in the end.

#### Fast box opening

At 1:10, I crouch during nearly 18 frames before opening the box which allows to reduce the first part of the animation (which is putting one knee on the ground). This saves nearly 36 frames. This is done multiple times during the run and I think it works only / better when boxes are on a flat ground.

#### No stun after fall

At 1:15 (and at many other moments), you can avoid being stunned after a medium fall by doing a roll just before falling.

#### Cutscene skip

At 1:47, you can avoid talking to this GI but, if you do, you would be able to skip a cutscene by being ahead of the two GIs until after the first tunnel and quickly rolling out the path (at 2:10) or the second cutscene will play there.

#### Ledge grab skip

At 3:41, you can avoid a ledge grab when going out the tunnel with a quite precise roll.

#### Manual aim during climbing

This trick has been [explained by BaronHaynes](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/syphon_filter_2/forums/rt8n8), you can see it in action at 4:11 (and occasionally during the run).

### Level 3

#### Skip the knife kill animation

At 10:24, just before the knife cut, a crouch is done. This allows to skip the knife kill animation.

#### Less time to target enemy

At 10:29, Gabe is raising his arm to target the high enemy. I take advantage of that move to only aim (L1) at that moment, not before, and so we can see that my gun sights is already high instead of in front of me.

#### Truck respawn

At 12:47, after waiting for Chance, a cutscene will play. After that, you will be respawned away from the truck where you get the grenades. To avoid that respawn, you have to grab the truck (or during the "from crouch to grab" animation) just before the cutscene plays.

### Level 4

#### Explosives' path shortcut

At 15:07, roll from explosive 2 to 3 without going up to the bridge.

### Level 5

#### Glitchy alert state

At 19:31, Lian is exiting the place when the army GI is in an alert state (because he has found the body of the agency pilot) and she's despawning him from the radar (if you exit before that, the mission fails because the alarm is triggered), this is the cause of a glitchy alert state. At that point, the mission can't fail because of being seen by the army GIs (but will fail if you are seen by Holman for example). It offers a couple of sequence breaks where you don't have to find some workarounds to avoid being seen by army GIs, it's very satisfactory. I've seen this glitch description in the comments section of L&K's run.

Just an extra note : I had to kill Morgan at 20:23 else Holman will never say to the airman "I can do without the escort, airman" afterward and so the game is kinda "softlocked" because Holman won't move.

### Level 6 & 7

#### Stun animation skip

When performing long jumps, if Gabe is landing further down then a stun animation is played. But if a grenade is exploding just before Gabe's landing then this stun animation is skipped. It has been made many times during the two train levels. But I can't explain why at 26:57 there's no stun animation here.

### Level 9

#### Vent routing

From this level, vents will be a part of the route to finish levels. Instead of always turning on corners, strafing is used instead else it may / will be slower.

#### Discussion skip (part of)

At 32:17, army GIs' discussion is shortened by quickly tasing the one next to the door. It could be even quicker by using the crossbow instead of the hand taser but as the crossbow arrows are limited, they will have to be managed differently afterward.

#### The "Pharcom shortcut"

At 34:00, by being quite precisely placed, this roll will allow to not go to the end of the alley and then go down from there.

#### Cutscene skip

At 34:42, throwing the grenade and waiting allows to skip the cutscene where two enemies are talking.

### Level 10

#### Better respawns

At 37:47, when grabbing the ledge during the cutscene, you won't appear behind Theresa after it but where you've grabbed (same idea at 38:52).

### Level 12

#### Street shortcut

At 46:38, it seems that touching something (here the lamp) during a too high fall resets the height where you begin to fall, allowing to not dying from it. I would say, it's the same idea on level 1 on the high fall after using the transponder at 4:24.

### Level 15

In L&K's run, the crossbow can be used so it's much more quicker (than just using the hand taser). This may be the main reason why the sections at 47m43 and 48m10 (in their video) are possible but not in this TAS.

### Level 16

#### Better respawns

At 59:12, grab here allows to not respawn in the middle of the room.

At 59:51, I've tried to go straightforward and being detected but the problem is just after the elevator. The enemies on the roof are good shooters (cf differences between normal and hard difficulty above) and so the survival time of Gregorov there is between 2 and 5 seconds, not more (because Lian don't say to him "Stay here" as everyone is alarted). So, I have to be undetected at the beginning of the phase.

### Level 17

For info, at 1:03:07, it's not possible to skip the knife kill animation here because Gabe (in this level) won't crouch when pressing X.

#### Gherson (long walk) skip

At 1:03:38, instead of killing the two guards (to then talk with Ramirez), take care of just the guard further down, go to Gherson and then kill the second guard. It will skip the long walk of Gherson.

### Level 18

In L&K's run, a "vent glitch" is made at 1h 3m 24s that I haven't managed to reproduce for the moment.

### Level 19

#### Aiming in the middle of a U-turn

At 1:12:51, this is a move I came across and made sometimes from there : instead of turning right to aim this guard, I do a U-turn but in the middle of the move I aim.

### Level 20

#### Theresa call skip

At 1:13:53, by grabbing the washing machine and move a little to the right, this will skip a call from Theresa.

#### Fast strafing

At 1:18:50, you can strafe quicker when pressing a direction then releasing it (precisely pressing during 21 frames and then releasing during 3 frames) instead of keeping the direction pressed.

#### Cutscene skip

At 1:19:24, by doing this right angle, it will skip a cutscene (even a second cutscene afterward) with Theresa.
